# System Monitoring Mastery 🚀

Welcome to the guide on mastering system monitoring with `bashtop`, `htop`, `top`, and more! Dive into the world of interactive system monitoring and take control of your system's health and performance.

## Getting Started 🌟

Before we dive in, ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come with `top` pre-installed. To get the most out of this guide, consider installing `htop` and `bashtop` for a more interactive experience.

- Install `htop`:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install htop # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install htop # CentOS/RHEL
  sudo dnf install htop # Fedora
  ```

- Install `bashtop`:

  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bashtop-monitor/bashtop
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install bashtop
  ```

## TOP - The Classic 🧐

`top` is the granddaddy of system monitoring tools. It provides a dynamic, real-time view of a running system.

- To launch `top`, simply type:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- Navigate within `top`:
  - **Shift + M**: Sort by memory usage
  - **Shift + P**: Sort by CPU usage
  - **h**: Show help

## HTOP - The Enhanced Version 🎨

`htop` is like `top` but with more features, including a colorful interface, easier navigation, and the ability to kill processes without entering their PID.

- Launch `htop`:
  ```bash
  htop
  ```

- Key features:
  - Use the arrow keys to navigate.
  - Press `F9` to kill a process.
  - `F2` to access setup.

## BASHTOP - The Eye Candy 🍭

`bashtop` is a beautiful resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network, and processes. It's the most visually appealing of the bunch.

- Start `bashtop`:
  ```bash
  bashtop
  ```

- Highlights:
  - Easy to use, with a game-like interface.
  - Detailed information about process sorting, including by CPU and memory.
  - A responsive UI with mouse support.
